To setup the ICR:
-----------------
https://cloud.ibm.com/registry/start

Install COS CSI install and setup storage class and PVC in IKS:
---------------------------------------------------------------
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_cos_install

If this is your first time connecting to an IBM Cloud cluster, see the following full setup directions.

1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account. Include the --sso option if using a federated ID.

install the ibmcloud command:
-----------------------------
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli

To login via command line:
-------------------------
ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r us-south -g Cloud-Dev --sso

After login install the following plugins:
------------------------------------------
ibmcloud plugin install container-service
ibmcloud plugin install container-registry


2. Set the Kubernetes context to your cluster for this terminal session. For more information about this command, see the docs.

Fetch the IKS details:
----------------------
ibmcloud ks cluster ls

Generate the kuebconfig of cluster:
-----------------------------------
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>


3. Verify that you can connect to your cluster.
kubectl config current-context

Now, you can run kubectl commands to manage your cluster workloads in IBM Cloud! For a full list of commands, see the Kubernetes deep dive videos on my channel. https://youtube.com/@devops-vu?si=K-6A4SOjPCtxgxxv

Tip: Plan to use multiple clusters? Repeat these steps for each cluster. Then, you can use the kubectl config use-context command to switch your context to a different cluster.

Some commands that can make your life easy:
------------------------------------------

kubectl get cm -n kube-system cluster-info -o yaml | grep etcd_host

ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>

To find the hostname of an ALB in a VPC cluster, run ibmcloud ks ingress alb ls. Private hostnames are only listed if private ALBs are enabled.

ibmcloud ks ingress alb ls

How to add new workers in cluster:
-----------------------------------

Get the name of the worker pool that you want to resize.

ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster CLUSTER-NAME

Resize the worker pool by designating the number of worker nodes that you want to deploy in each zone.

ibmcloud ks worker-pool resize --cluster CLUSTER-NAME --worker-pool <pool_name>  --size-per-zone <number_of_workers_per_zone>

Verify that the worker pool is resized.

ibmcloud ks worker ls --cluster CLUSTER-NAME --worker-pool <pool_name>
